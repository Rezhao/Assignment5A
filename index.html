    <p>Notes to Grader: I implemented a heart, triangles, cubes, and a sphere. One of the cubes
      is textured with a candy image and three of the shapes are animated (a triangle and two cubes).
      There is also a 3D model of a castle in the middle, as well as a directional and hemisphere 
      light source and camera with perspective projection. Orbit controls are implemented as well 
      so you can click and zoom in on the piece.
