    <p>Notes to Grader: I implemented a 3D world of a forest representation. I wanted to recreate a place that is 
      calming yet fun and colorful. I added a bench where people can sit and observe the waterfall. I also have a 
      welcome sign at the very front with hearts surrounding it. I created a rainbow as well because I think those 
      are pretty to look at and fit with my theme of nature. For fun, I also wanted to add some sprinkles/sparkles 
      to spice up the world and make it look more fun. I made them rotate as well. I also implemented a fog system
      where as you zoom out, the fog covers up the world. I created the trees, rainbow, bench, and sparkles by just 
      using the three.js primitives.
