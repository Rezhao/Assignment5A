    <p>Notes to Grader: Can rotate camera by clicking and dragging and can move camera position
      by right clicking and dragging (implemented using orbit controls). I have 3 different light 
      sources: hemisphere, directional, and spotlight. I have a skybox that uses a 360 degree view
      sky background. I also have at least 20 primary shapes implemented through the trees and shapes 
      floating around.
